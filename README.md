# Spam_Ham_Detection

We have tried building a spam detection filter using Python and Spark. Our data set consists of volunteered text messages from a study in Singapore and some spam texts from a UK reporting site. 

A spam is an irrelevant or inappropriate message sent on internet to a large group of people. A Ham, on the other hand, is a message which is not a spam and is important to us. 
We aim to segregate these two messages and classify them as accurately as possible.
